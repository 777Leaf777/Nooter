# Nooter
Nooter Converts a MIDI audio file to a WAV audio file but each noot is replaced with a NOOT sound effect from the cartoon character pingu.

Simply replace input.mid with your desired song in the MIDI format, then run nooter.py

If your output is too fast/slow you may need to adjust the rate in nooter.py

Nooter.py requires the following:

Python 3 Interperter
pretty_midi library
librosa library
numpy library
